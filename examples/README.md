## cagliari.60.-30

Sundial for Cagliari, Italy. Wall facing south-west-ish (30 degrees
from south towards west) and not vertical (60 degrees, instead of 90).
You can see the Italic hours in green (sunset is the horizontal one,
and then we have -1, -2, .., -6) and Babylonian hours in blue. The
analemma is set on the UTC+1 meridian. A red dashed line gives the
measure for a vertical gnomon to be placed at the center of the disk
(marked by an x).
